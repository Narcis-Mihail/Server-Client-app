# Server-Client-app
# Client/Server Communication Program

Suppose the program ClientIPv4_win_2023.exe is running on each teamâ€™s workstation under   Windows 10, with IPv4 protocol enabled. Create a client/server program, using C language under Linux which implements the following tasks: 

- Establish a stream socket-based communication using IPv4 with the `ClientIPv4_win_2023.exe` program.
- Set up a Linux server to listen for incoming client requests on port 22111.
- Configure the IPv4 client to connect to all assigned IP addresses of the IPv4 server.
- Process the command "xy#" (where xy can be any two-digit number from 01 to 20) received from the `ClientIPv4_win_2023.exe` program.
- Ensure the IPv6 client establishes a connection to the URL of the HTTP IPv6 server.

Please note that these tasks are designed for a specific client-server architecture and should be adjusted according to the actual network configuration and requirements. Always ensure proper security measures are in place when setting up network communications.
